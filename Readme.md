here is the zip file containing the source code of the Petdrifts App. (CrossPlatform)

Extract the Petdrifts zip file, then open the command prompt inside that folder and run the below command:

for android : (open cmd from Petdrifts folder and run below commands)
1) npm install --legacy-peer-deps
2) react-native run-android

go to the ios folder located inside Petdrifts and run cmd:
1) pod-install
